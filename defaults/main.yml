# This variable is used to state if the system where
# the role is executed is a container image or not.
# The role discovers this dinamically and sets this
# variable's value to 'true' or it leaves it unchanged
# ('false') based on its findings.
system_is_container: false
# This variable holds the name of the "yml" file, in which
# the role would store the container's variables. This
# file would get created only if the role determines that
# it is executed on a container image.
container_vars_file: is_container.yml

# This variable is used to run the OS version and family
# check. This validation check determines if the role is
# executed against a supported OS. Setting it to 'true' will
# mean that the OS validation will be executed. Setting it
# to 'false' would mean otherwise.
# If you know that your OS finds itself among the supported
# Oss then this variable's value does not need to be changed.
# If not, you should change it accordingly - see README e.g. CentOS

# This variable refers to Legacy Boot, also known as
# Legacy BIOS boot, which is a boot mode that emulates
# the traditional BIOS. The variable is used in a task
# that ensures the necessary permissions on the bootloader
# config are in place. Setting the value to 'true', will mean
# that those permisions will be set for the configuration of
# BIOS boot. Setting it to 'false', will mean that the Legacy
# Boot (BIOS boot) is not in use, which means that the
# permissions will have to be set for the configuration of
# efi boot.

# would reboot the system before audit, which could
# give better audit results.
skip_reboot: true

# This variable is used in a handler task, that is notified

## Section 1 Control Variables
##

## Control 1.1.2 - Configure /tmp
# This variable is used in order to determine which method
# shall be used by the role in order to ensure that the
# "nodev,noexec,nosuid" options are set for "/tmp".
# If it is set to 'true', the role will use the tmp.mount
# service otherwise, the role will use the fstab configuration.
amzn2023cis_tmp_svc: true

## Control 1.9 - Ensure system-wide crypto policy is not legacy
# This variable helps in determining which type of crypto policy
# the role will set. As per the description of Control 1.9,
# the "LEGACY" option is not to be used! A reason for this would
# be the fact that "LEGACY" includes older algorithms that might
# be considered less secure. You can choose from other options
# such as:
# "DEFAULT" - includes a set of cryptographic algorithms that are
#             considered secure;
# "FUTURE"  - may include newer algorithms that will replace older
#             ones;
# "FIPS"    - designed to comply with specific cryptographic standards
#             defined by NIST. They are often required in certain
#             government or regulated environments;

# AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire.
# While it cannot prevent intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes
# to configuration files by alerting when the files are changed. Review

# These are the crontab settings for periodical checking of the filesystem's
# integrity using AIDE. The sub-settings of this variable provide the parameters
# required to configure the cron job on the target system.

## Control 1.6.1.3 - Ensure SELinux policy is configured
# SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). The SELinux policy uses
# a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other
# and the various system resources. There are two such policies:
# "targeted" - targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain.
#              In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to,
#              are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the
#              attacker’s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is
#              also limited;
# "mls"      - implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds
#              of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based
#              on these;
# The following variable is used to choose which type of SELinux policy will be configured
# by the role.
# CIS provides guidance for the configuration of the "targeted" policy!
amzn2023cis_selinux_pol: targeted

## Control 1.6.1.4 - Ensure the SELinux mode is not disabled
# SELinux can run in one of three modes. This variable is used to select which
# mode shall be used. These are the options:
# "enforcing"  - Is the default, and recommended, mode of operation; in enforcing
#                mode SELinux operates normally, enforcing the loaded security policy
#                on the entire system;
# "permissive" - The system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy,
#                including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs,
#                but it does not actually deny any operations. While not recommended for
#                production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy
#                development;
# "disabled"   - Is strongly DISCOURAGED; not only does the system avoid enforcing the
#                SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as
#                files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future;

## Controls 3.4.1.x and 3.4.2.x Firewall Service
# This variable represents the toggle for which firewall service is used.
# The options are either firewalld or nftables.
amzn2023cis_firewall: firewalld

## Control 3.4.2.1 - Ensure firewalld default zone is set
# This variable specifies which default zone should be set
# for firewalld. A firewall zone defines the trust level for
# a connection, interface or source address binding. The
# default zone is the zone that is used for everything that
# is not explicitly bound/assigned to another zone.
# Options are:
# "block"        - All incoming connections are dropped with an
#                  icmp-host-prohibited message. Only network
#                  connections initiated from within the system
#                  are possible;
# "**drop**"     - This is the zone with the lowest level of trust.
#                  All incoming connections are dropped with no reply,
#                  and only outgoing connections are allowed;
# "public"       - This represents untrusted networks. It is implemented
#                  when you don't trust other servers on the network.
#                  This is recommended when you have a server hosted on
#                  the cloud or local network;
# "external"     - Used when you want to configure the firewall as a NAT
#                  gateway. The external zone is used for NAT masquerading
#                  such that your internal network stays private but
#                  reachable from external systems;
# "**internal**" - Used for internal networks when you trust other
#                  computers or servers on your LAN;
# "dmz"          - Used for servers or computers in a DMZ ( Demilitarized Zone ).
#                  These will not be accessible to systems on your network
#                  and only specific incoming connections are allowed;
# "work"         - Used at your place of work where you trust most
#                  of the computers and co-workers' PCs;
# "home"         - Used in the home environment especially on desktops and laptops on
#                  your LAN. The implication is that you trust most of the
#                  devices on your home LAN and that some services are allowed;
# "trusted"      - All connections are accepted;
amzn2023cis_default_zone: public

## Control 3.4.2.2 - Ensure at least one nftables table exists
# With this variable you can chose if you want to automatically

# This variable decides whether the system is considered to be a log
# server or not. In the case of option 'true' being selected, the role
# will not proceed to implement control 5.1.1.7. Otherwise, rsyslog
# will not receive logs from a remote client!
amzn2023cis_system_is_log_server: true

## Control 5.1.2.1.2 - Ensure systemd-journal-remote is configured
# The following variable represents the IP address where the entries
# of the journal will be uploaded to.

## to create their own custom paths!
# This variable represents the path to the private key used by
# systemd-journal-remote. The key is part of the server's
# configuration for secure communication.
amzn2023cis_journal_upload_serverkeyfile: "/etc/ssl/private/journal-upload.pem"
# This variable represents the path to the server certificate file
# used by systemd-journal-remote. This certificate is used to verify
# the server's identity.
amzn2023cis_journal_servercertificatefile: "/etc/ssl/certs/journal-upload.pem"

## Control 5.1.2.6 - Ensure journald log rotation is configured per site policy
## The variables below are related to journald log rotation,
## please set these to your site's specific values!
# This variable represents the max amount of disk space the logs will use.
# When the journal files exceed this size, older journal files
# are deleted to keep the disk space usage below the specified
# limit. The value is in megabytes.
amzn2023cis_journald_systemmaxuse: 10M
# This variable represents the amount of disk space to be kept free.
# If the free disk space falls below this threshold, older logs are
# deleted to free up space. The value is in gigabytes.
amzn2023cis_journald_systemkeepfree: 100G
# This variable is similar to "amzn2023cis_journald_systemmaxuse"
# only that it refers to in-memory space. "Runtime" is about logs
# that are stored in memory (RAM) and are not present on disk.
# These logs are temporary and exist only for the duration
# of the current system runtime.
amzn2023cis_journald_runtimemaxuse: 10M
# This variable is similar to "amzn2023cis_journald_systemkeepfree"
# only that it refers to in-memory space that should be kept free.
# "Runtime" is about logs that are stored in memory (RAM) and are not
# present on disk. These logs are temporary and exist only for the
# duration of the current system runtime.
amzn2023cis_journald_runtimekeepfree: 100G
# This variable sets the maximum time that logs are retained on disk.
# Logs older than the specified duration are deleted.
# Values are Xm, Xh, Xday, Xweek, Xmonth, Xyear.
# For example: "2week" i.e. two weeks
amzn2023cis_journald_maxfilesec: 1month

## Control 5.2.1.3 - Ensure audit_backlog_limit is sufficient
# This variable represents the audit backlog limit, i.e. the maximum number of audit records that the
# system can buffer in memory, if the audit subsystem is unable to process them in real-time.
# Buffering in memory is useful in situations, where the audit system is overwhelmed
# with incoming audit events, and needs to temporarily store them until they can be processed.
# This variable should be set to a sufficient value. The CIS baseline recommends at least `8192`.
amzn2023cis_audit_back_log_limit: '8192'

## Control 5.2.2.1 - Ensure audit log storage size is configured
# This variable specifies the maximum size in MB that an audit log file can reach,
# before it is archived or deleted to make space for the new audit data.

    #            low;
    # "suspend" - the system suspends recording audit events until more space is available;
    # "single"  - the audit daemon will put the computer system in single user mode;
    # "halt"    - the system is halted when disk space is critically low;
    space_left_action: email
    # This variable specifies an e-mail address or alias to which any alert messages
    # should be sent. The default setting is root, but you can enter any local or
    # remote account as long as e-mail and the network are properly configured on
    # your system and /usr/lib/sendmail exists.
    action_mail_acct: root
    # This variable tells the system what action to take when the system has detected

    # "single"  - the audit daemon will put the computer system in single user mode;
    # "halt"    - the system is halted when disk space is critically low;
    # CIS prescribes either `halt` or `single`.
    admin_space_left_action: halt
    # This variable determines what action the audit system should take when the maximum
    # size of a log file is reached.
    # The options for setting this variable are as follows:
    # "ignore"    - the system does nothing when the size of a log file is full;
    # "syslog"    - a message is sent to the system log indicating the problem;
    # "suspend"   - the system suspends recording audit events until the log file is cleared or rotated;
    # "rotate"    - the log file is rotated (archived) and a new empty log file is created;
    # "keep_logs" - the system attempts to keep as many logs as possible without violating disk
    #               space constraints;
    # CIS prescribes the value `keep_logs`.

## Control 5.2.3.x - Audit template
# This variable's value controls the execution of a main task
# responsible for importing the yml file needed for configuring
# the auditd rules (auditd.yml). The default value is 'false',
# but tasks responsible for the configuration mentioned earlier,
# are setting it to 'true'.
update_audit_template: false

# This variable is used to condition the execution of a POST task
# from the "auditd.yml" file. That task implements an advanced option
# and it only gets executed if this variable's value is set to 'true'.
# The advance option sets users whose actions are not logged by auditd.
amzn2023cis_allow_auditd_uid_user_exclusions: false

# This variable can be used to configure other keys in auditd.conf
# Example:
# amzn2023cis_auditd_extra_conf:
#     admin_space_left: '10%'
amzn2023cis_auditd_extra_conf:
    # This variable governs the threshold(MegaBytes) under which the audit daemon should perform a
    # specific action to alert that the system is running low on disk space. Must be lower than
    # the 'space_left' variable.
    admin_space_left: 50
    # This variable governs the threshold(MegaBytes) under which the audit daemon should perform a
    # specific action to alert that the system is running low on disk space(last chance to do something
    # before running out of disk space). Must be lower than the 'space_left' variable.
